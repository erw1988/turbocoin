# Turbocoin
Turbocoin is a cryptocurrency based on Gridcoin. It is remuneration for helping complete jobs that assist in finding proofs for the existence and smoothness problems of Navier-Stokes equations.

# Why this?
One of the most pressing unsolved problems in the world of physical science is turbulence. The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of equations that, as of right now, offer a mathematical conception for observing turbulence. But we only know it works on a 2D plane. Without a full understanding of turbulence, we do not know why it happens. For example, why would a smooth, steady stream of smoke, with no other apparent force acting on it (save for gravity), change from its calm state to being suddenly diffused. The answer is, we have no real clue. We have hints, conjecture, but no solid mathematical or observational understanding of why it happens.

Enter: the smoothness and existence of the Navier-Stokes equations. We know that the N-S equations look elegant on a 2D plane and gives us insight into fluid dynamics to a point, but things fall off the rails once three dimensions are introduced. In investigating this, we may be able to gain an understanding of turbulence acting upon fluids. (There's a whole lot more to it than this, where you can read at the Millenium Prize whitepaper [here](https://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/navierstokes.pdf).)

# Here, we hope Turbocoin can help.
Turbocoin leverages the incentive of cryptocurrency mining, by awarding each volunteer Turbocoin for every job they run using their free computer space. The jobs run off of a BOINC server and will dump publicly available data onto a website, to help mathematicians and scientists who are interested in helping provide proofs about the 3D existence (or non-existence) of the Navier-Stokes equations.

Upon launch of the project, Turbocoin should be tradeable as a cryptocurrency on all reputable crypto exchanges. We hope to foster a community around solving this imminently important mystery that will help us understand critical questions about our physical environment. We hope you will be apart of the solution.
